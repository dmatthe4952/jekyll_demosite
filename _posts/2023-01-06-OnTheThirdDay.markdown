This is the third post on the third day. I still am not a fan of blogging, but I am getting used to it. It
seems like a big waste of time to me, since I am not convinced that anyone wants to hear from me. Right now
I am trying to test the excerpt function in this page, so I will keep on typing...blah, blah, blah...until
I have enough content to see the truncated content.

Evidently that wasn't enough content to get to the break, so here is more content for you, the reader to yawn
over. I really hate this inane posting of useless content in order to create an ego stroking blog.  There must be
a really superfluidity of ego in this country to decide that this is a valuable use of anyone's time and resources.

Well, it seems tha the end of the first paragraph was enough to trigger the truncation.  Success!!!
